tags: android recyclerview cursors adapter content provider

Every time I start a new Android project I know for a fact that there will be
some sort of content provider/resolver laden snake pit that I will inevitably fall
into. Most recently it was trying to get RecyclerViews to play nicely with Cursors.
Cursors, of course are what gets returned by a content resolver when it queries the SQLite
datastore that comes baked into Android [^1].  

The issue is one of multiple inheritance. a standard RecyclerView adapter definition looks like:

[^1]: <small> I know what you're going to say: "Don't use SQLite! Use ----", where ---- is one of a number of options. This post isn't for you </small>
